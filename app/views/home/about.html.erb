<h1>About</h1>
<p>Domatio is a web app that serves as a tool for roommates living together. First time users will create an account to the website and log in. They will then create a group and invite their roommates to the group. After everything is set up, they will login and see a portal. The portal will include many tools like a bill splitter that allow users to set up bills (recurring or otherwise) and then split the cost between the roommates. The website will also keep track of who paid and allow users to send money online with Paypal. There will also be a schedule uploader, that allows users to upload their schedules and compare them with one another, finding best times for movie nights and chores. This feature will integrate with the next two features: a movie night suggester and a chore scheduler. The chore scheduler will give everyone in the house a chore and use their schedules to suggest the best times for them to do that chore. The movie night scheduler, will use the IMdB websiteâ€™s API to display the top ten movies and then allow the roommates to pick from those and discuss. There will of course, also be discussion threads on the website, as well as many other features. We feel that the nature of our webapp is very modular and it will be simple to add or change features. The website backend is primarily written in Ruby, using the Rails framework. We will also have a few databases using PostgreSQL and ActiveRecord. There will also be some HTML/Javascript/CSS for the frontend of the website. </p>
